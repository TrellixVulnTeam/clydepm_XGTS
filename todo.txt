    Correct include path handling
        Right now package/include is passed directly as a
        -Ipath/top/package/include

        This is a problem if an include includes another header from the
        current package, which is 
        generally poor form, but sometimes necessary.


        There are two ways to do this


        per-packge include in a prefixed directory, so
        including packge-a/stuff.h would be accomplished with
        #include <package-a/stuff.h>
            
            include
               |- packge-name
                  |-packge-include.h

        This might conflict with the 'standard' way where
        all include files go in the same directory
            include
              |-packge-a-include.h
              |-packge-b-include.h

        The issue here is that we could have problems with namespacing, where
        two packages have a common.h or similar

        The current form of the package manager doesn't actually keep track of
        which file are owned by which package when 'installing' (copying files
        into the current package buing built), since the namespaces make it
        unnecessary

        So, is it better to do it the 'standard' way, and build out package
        ownership of files, maybe getting into per-package ownership of files?

        Or leave it as is, and maybe have some problems with third party
        packages? I'm not sure if they will actually break


Also important:

    Ability to pull packages from gerrit.   

        This probably means, try to get project-name from
        gerrit/firmware/packages/project-name, and store 
        in local git cache
