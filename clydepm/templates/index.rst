   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

{{name}}
============================

This is a basic documentation template

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   
   other


.. You can add other things to the toc tree. There needs  
   to be a filename named other.rst in this example. It will 
   be linked automatically by sphinx
